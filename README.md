###Description###

Homework assignment for week 2, iOS Bootcamp for Designers. Had a lot of trouble with this assignment. Mostly related to time management and prioritization, but also had several huge crashes in Xcode. The final of which broke everything, tried making a new project and copying in the old files but that didn't work. Uploaded assignment contains all the (working) code and I managed to complete the gif before everything broke. It should also be noted that hoydb helped me by providing some of the code as commented in the source, this because we are on the same team and I needed help completing it in time (which I still didn't haha). 


###Time Spent###

~10hrs. Terrible time management on my part. Should've started much sooner, lots of problems with xcode/yosemite. I will rectify this for the following assignments.
